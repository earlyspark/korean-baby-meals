                Hi, I&apos;m earlyspark â€” a new mom trying to figure out what to feed my baby now that she can eat almost anything. I want meals and snacks that are nutritious (not overly processed), that I can prep in batches and freeze, because I work full-time, don&apos;t live near family, and definitely can&apos;t afford a personal chef.
              </p>

              <p>
                I built this site in three nights using AI because I was tired of endlessly scrolling Instagram and Pinterest just to figure out what to make with half a zucchini and some leftover rice. Who has time for that?? Also, I wanted my baby to grow up eating Korean food and being proud of this part of her heritage, never feeling like she has to set it aside to fit in.
              </p>

                Korean Baby Meals is for busy caregivers who want to feed their kids diverse, healthy food without spending hours researching. It has practical filters I wish every recipe site had. If there&apos;s something else you wish the site could do â€” send me a message on{' '}

                . I&apos;ll see if I can build it. If there&apos;s a parenting or meal-prep pain point you think software could solve, I want to hear about it. I&apos;ll try to vibe-code it into existence. I&apos;m here to use AI for good.
